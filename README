The app uses an in-memory user.
Username: admin
Password: admin123
Notes:


You can change credentials in SecurityConfig.java (the userDetailsService bean).


/actuator/prometheus and /export/** are currently permitted without auth (so Prometheus can scrape and you can download CSV/XLSX). If you want them protected, tell me and I’ll show how to require auth while still allowing Prometheus to scrape.


* mvn clean package -DskipTests
* java -jar target/spring-prometheus-demo-1.0.0.jar
* curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/prometheus

I have developed this because i wanted to test HTTP request rate and HTTP error rate.
